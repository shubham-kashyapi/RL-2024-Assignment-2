# RL-2024-Assignment-2
Dueling DQN and MC Reinforce

This repository includes implementation of two variants each of the above two algorithms. We use these algorithms to learn policies for the Acrobot and Cartpole environments.

The repo contains the following two directories with Jupyter notebooks that contain the code and results.

1) DDQN
2) MC-Reinforce
